## Overview

The Transaction Service (`TxService`) is a core component of [EloqDB](https://github.com/eloqdata), a modular database designed for high-performance transaction and scalability. It is not tied to a specific database but serves as a versatile, distributed in-memory storage and transaction layer. By integrating with various database runtimes and storage engines, such as [EloqSQL](https://github.com/eloqdata/eloqsql), it enables seamless scalability and fine-grained transaction support.

For example, in EloqSQL, the InnoDB storage engine of MariaDB is replaced with EloqDB's distributed storage engine. SQL read and write requests are transformed into transaction requests (`TxRequests`) and routed to the `TxService`. Data is sharded across the cluster, allowing a MariaDB client to connect to any node and execute SQL queries (with multiple-writer support). The `TxService` handles request redirection transparently, abstracting the cluster size from the client.

## Features

### üóÉÔ∏è Distributed Cache
Scales out across multiple nodes and leverages multi-core CPUs. Data and requests are sharded into `CcShards`, each processed by a dedicated `TxProcessor`‚Äîa lock-free worker thread pinned to a single CPU core for optimal performance.

### ‚ö° Concurrency Control
Supports two protocols: **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)** and **Two-Phase Locking (2PL)**. Offers **ReadCommitted** and **RepeatableRead** isolation levels. Includes a novel **one-phase commit** protocol for distributed transactions, significantly reducing overhead.

### üìÑ Durable
Ensures durability by storing transaction redo logs in the [Log Service](https://github.com/eloqdata/log_service).

### üîÑ Elastic
Dynamically scales in or out to adapt to changing workloads.

### üí™ Fault Tolerance
Stateless and resilient to node failures. Recovers data from the log service and underlying storage engines like **RocksDB**, **Cassandra**, **ScyllaDB**, **DynamoDB**, or object storage.

## Build from Source

The Transaction Service is a foundational engine of EloqDB and can be built alongside these projects:
- [EloqKV](https://github.com/eloqdata/eloqkv)  
- [EloqSQL](https://github.com/eloqdata/eloqsql)  
- [EloqDoc](https://github.com/eloqdata/eloqdoc)  

It can also be built standalone for unit testing:

```bash
mkdir bld
cd bld
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j
ctest
```
