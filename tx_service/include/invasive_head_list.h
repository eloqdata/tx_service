/**
 * @brief A concurrent list that only allows to add and remove from the head.
 * The list is invasive in that it assumes the element class has a member
 * variable next_ pointing to the next element in the list. Adding and removing
 * from the head concurrently is usually a bad idea as it causes contention on a
 * single point between producers (adders) and consumers (removers). However,
 * the design serves well in two scenarios. First, producers and consumers are
 * in most cases from the same thread. This is the case when we use it as a
 * resource pool in a shard, which in normal execution has a single worker
 * thread. Second, the list has a single consumer who always tries to pop all
 * elements at once. This is the case when the worker thread of the shard in
 * every loop gets all inbound requests and resumed transactions to process.
